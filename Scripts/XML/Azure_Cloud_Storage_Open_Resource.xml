		<Description>Azure blob storage is Microsoft's persistent Cloud data storage. A blob can be any type of text or binary data, such as a document, media file, or application installer. By default, a container and any blobs within it may be accessed only by the owner of the storage account. If you want to give anonymous users read permissions to a container and its blobs, you can set the container permissions to allow public access. Anonymous users can read blobs within a publicly accessible container without authenticating the request.

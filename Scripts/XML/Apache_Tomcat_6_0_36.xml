		<Description>The following problems were fixed in Apache Tomcat version 6.0.36: [break][break]

[ul]

[li]
[bold]Important: Denial of service CVE-2012-2733[/bold][break]
The checks that limited the permitted size of request headers were implemented too late in the request parsing process for the HTTP NIO connector. This enabled a malicious user to trigger an OutOfMemoryError by sending a single request with very large headers.
This was fixed in revision 1356208.
[/li]

[li]
[bold]DIGEST authentication weakness CVE-2012-3439[/bold][break]
Three weaknesses in Tomcat's implementation of DIGEST authentication were identified and resolved:[break]
Tomcat tracked client rather than server nonces and nonce count.[break]
When a session ID was present, authentication was bypassed.[break]
The user name and password were not checked before when indicating that a nonce was stale.[break]
These issues reduced the security of DIGEST authentication making replay attacks possible in some circumstances.
[/li]

[li]
[bold]Important: Bypass of security constraints CVE-2012-3546[/bold][break]
When using FORM authentication it was possible to bypass the security constraint checks in the FORM authenticator by appending /j_security_check to the end of the URL if some other component (such as the Single-Sign-On valve) had called request.setUserPrincipal() before the call to FormAuthenticator#authenticate(). This was fixed in revision 1381035.
[/li]

[li]
[bold]Important: Bypass of CSRF prevention filter CVE-2012-4431[/bold][break]
The CSRF prevention filter could be bypassed if a request was made to a protected resource without a session identifier present in the request.
This was fixed in revision 1394456.
[/li]

[li]
[bold]Important: Denial of service CVE-2012-4534[/bold][break]
When using the NIO connector with sendfile and HTTPS enabled, if a client breaks the connection while reading the response an infinite loop is entered leading to a denial of service. This was originally reported as bug 52858.

This was fixed in revision 1372035.

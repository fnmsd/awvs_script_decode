[li][bold]moderate[/bold]: mod_proxy crash CVE-2007-3847[break]

    A flaw was found in the Apache HTTP Server mod_proxy module. On sites where a reverse proxy is configured, a remote attacker could send a carefully crafted request that would cause the Apache child process handling that request to crash. On sites where a forward proxy is configured, an attacker could cause a similar crash if a user could be persuaded to visit a malicious site using the proxy. This could lead to a denial of service if using a threaded Multi-Processing Module.[/li]

[li][bold]moderate[/bold]: mod_status cross-site scripting CVE-2006-5752[break]

    A flaw was found in the mod_status module. On sites where the server-status page is publicly accessible and ExtendedStatus is enabled this could lead to a cross-site scripting attack. Note that the server-status page is not enabled by default and it is best practice to not make this publicly available.
[/li]

[li][bold]moderate[/bold]: Signals to arbitrary processes CVE-2007-3304[break]

The Apache HTTP server did not verify that a process was an Apache child process before sending it signals. A local attacker with the ability to run scripts on the HTTP server could manipulate the scoreboard and cause arbitrary processes to be terminated which could lead to a denial of service.[/li]

[li][bold]moderate[/bold]: mod_cache proxy DoS CVE-2007-1863[break]

A bug was found in the mod_cache module. On sites where caching is enabled, a remote attacker could send a carefully crafted request that would cause the Apache child process handling that request to crash. This could lead to a denial of service if using a threaded Multi-Processing Module.[/li]

This script is possibly vulnerable to cross-site request forgery. Cross Site Reference Forgery (CSRF/XSRF) is a class of attack that affects web based applications with a predictable structure for invocation. An attacker tricks the user into performing an action of the attackers choosing by directing the victim's actions on the target application with a link or other content.[break]
The attack works by including a link or script in a page that accesses a site to which the user is known (or is supposed) to have authenticated. Here is an example:
[pre]
&lt;img src="http://bank.example/withdraw?from=victim&amp;amount=1000000&amp;to=attacker"&gt;
[/pre]
If the bank keeps authentication information in a cookie, and if the cookie hasn't expired, then victim's browser's attempt to load the image will submit the withdrawal form with his cookie.[break][break]
This vulnerability is also known by several other names including Session Riding and One-Click Attack.
